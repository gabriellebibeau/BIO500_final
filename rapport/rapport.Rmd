  Please provide details of author contributions here.

abstract: |
  Please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words in a single paragraph. Abstracts should explain to the general reader the major contributions of the article. References in the abstract must be cited in full within the abstract itself and cited in the text.


significance: |
  Authors must submit a 120-word maximum statement about the significance of their research paper written at a level understandable to an undergraduate educated scientist outside their field of speciality. The primary goal of the Significance Statement is to explain the relevance of the work in broad context to a broad readership. The Significance Statement appears in the paper itself and is required for all research papers.

This PNAS journal template is provided to help you write your work in the
correct journal format. Instructions for use are provided below.

Note: please start your introduction without including the word
"Introduction" as a section heading (except for math articles in the
Physical Sciences section); this heading is implied in the first
paragraphs.

Guide to using this template {.unnumbered}
========================================

Please note that whilst this template provides a preview of the typeset
manuscript for submission, to help in this preparation, it will not
necessarily be the final publication layout. For more detailed
information please see the [PNAS Information for
Authors](http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/format.xhtml).


Author Affiliations {#author-affiliations .unnumbered}
-------------------

Include department, institution, and complete address, with the
ZIP/postal code, for each author. Use lower case letters to match
authors with institutions, as shown in the example. Authors with an
ORCID ID may supply this information at submission.

Submitting Manuscripts {#submitting-manuscripts .unnumbered}
----------------------

All authors must submit their articles at
[PNAScentral](http://www.pnascentral.org/cgi-bin/main.plex). If you are
using Overleaf to write your article, you can use the "Submit to PNAS"
option in the top bar of the editor window.

Format {#format .unnumbered}
------

Many authors find it useful to organize their manuscripts with the
following order of sections; Title, Author Affiliation, Keywords,
Abstract, Significance Statement, Results, Discussion, Materials and
methods, Acknowledgments, and References. Other orders and headings are
permitted.

Manuscript Length {#manuscript-length .unnumbered}
-----------------

PNAS generally uses a two-column format averaging 67 characters,
including spaces, per line. The maximum length of a Direct Submission
research article is six pages and a PNAS PLUS research article is ten
pages including all text, spaces, and the number of characters displaced
by figures, tables, and equations. When submitting tables, figures,
and/or equations in addition to text, keep the text for your manuscript
under 39,000 characters (including spaces) for Direct Submissions and
72,000 characters (including spaces) for PNAS PLUS.

References {#references .unnumbered}
----------

References should be cited in numerical order as they appear in text;
this will be done automatically via bibtex, e.g. @belkin2002using and
@berard1994embedding [@coifman2005geometric]. All references, including
for the SI, should be included in the main manuscript file. References
appearing in both sections should not be duplicated. SI references
included in tables should be included with the main reference section.

Data Archival {#data-archival .unnumbered}
-------------

PNAS must be able to archive the data essential to a published article.
Where such archiving is not possible, deposition of data in public
databases, such as GenBank, ArrayExpress, Protein Data Bank, Unidata,
and others outlined in the Information for Authors, is acceptable.



Language-Editing Services {#language-editing-services .unnumbered}
-------------------------

Prior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit
from professional editing are encouraged to use a language-editing
service (see list at www.pnas.org/site/authors/language-editing.xhtml).
PNAS does not take responsibility for or endorse these services, and
their use has no bearing on acceptance of a manuscript for publication.
