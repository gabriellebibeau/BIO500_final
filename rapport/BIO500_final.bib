	abstract = {Ecology and Biodiversity of Benthos provides insights into the characteristic features of marine and estuarine benthos that play an important role in coastal ecosystem functioning, a primary level in the food chain. The book provides the latest information on multidisciplinary reflections by various researchers studying the benthic community. Through the chapters, ecosystem services are explored as a way to share approaches and scientific methods to achieve knowledge-based sustainable planning and management of benthic ecosystems. This is a helpful guide for anyone working on marine and estuarine environments, and for those who need an introduction to benthic ecology. The book has a wide range of scientific coverage since it caters primarily to the requirement of marine ecologists, marine benthologists, EIA experts, aquatic researchers, scientists, teachers and research scholars. In addition to this, it also serves as a reference for postgraduate/undergraduate students studying aquatic ecosystems. Includes analytical methods and detailed statistical interpretation for qualitative and quantitative analyses of marine and estuarine benthic community structures Presents figures, schematic diagrams and photographs related to benthic diversity of coastal ecosystem to aid in understanding protocols for the assessment of the benthic community's structure and function Includes case studies throughout each chapter to increase understanding of benthic communities},

	abstract = {The primary components of the physical habitat in a stream are water depth, velocity and substrate size, and these appear to be the best predictors of benthic invertebrate distribution within a stream. Substrate stability and fine sediment deposition also influence benthic invertebrate abundance, with reduced abundance where substrates are frequently disturbed or where fine sediment accumulates. Substrate stability and deposition of fine sediment provide hydraulic constraints on habitat suitability and their limits can be predicted by hydraulic formulae. Hydraulic conditions near or at the surface of the stream bed may have a more direct influence on benthic invertebrates than either water depth or mean velocity in the water column above them. If benthic invertebrates have ‘preferred’ near-bed conditions, hydraulic considerations suggest that optimum mean water velocities for benthic invertebrates should increase with average stream depth and substrate size. Examination of three sets of field data from rivers of varying size showed that benthic invertebrate abundance was strongly related to mean velocity and substrate size, with large differences in habitat use between species. However, although there were large differences in preferred mean velocities between rivers of different size and depth, there was little evidence that this occurred within rivers of similar size and hence little support for the hypothesis that near-bed hydraulics can provide a generalized method of predicting invertebrate habitat suitability between rivers of different size.
